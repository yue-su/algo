‚ùì PROMPT
The infrastructure department of our city is evaluating the coverage and efficiency of the placement of street lamps. Ideally we want locations on the roads to be covered by one light.

Each light on a road has a position along that road (an integer) and a radius. A light at a point P with radius R lights the road at positions from `P - R` to `P + R`, inclusive.

Given an array of lamps, each being a 2 value array of `[position, radius]`, how many locations are lit by exactly one light?

Example(s)
litByOneLight([[1, 1],[2, 1]]) => 2
litByOneLight([[1, 1]]) => 3
litByOneLight([[1, 1], [2, 1]]) => 2
litByOneLight([[1, 1], [3, 1]]) => 4
litByOneLight([[1, 1], [4, 1]]) => 6
